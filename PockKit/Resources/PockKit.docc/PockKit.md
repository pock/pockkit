# ``PockKit``

Display custom widgets inside MacBook Proâ€™s Touch Bar.

## Overview

Thanks to PockKit, [Pock](https://pock.app) can give macOS the ability to display custom widgets inside your MacBook's Touch Bar.

In this documentation, we will cover all the steps required to build a widget for Pock, starting from the foundation until covering more advanced scenarios, including adding a custom preference pane with ``PockKit/PKWidgetPreference`` and integrating ``PockKit/PKScreenEdgeMouseDelegate`` to allow the cursor to interact with our widget.

The first step to start creating a widget is to follow the instructions included in the <doc:Install-Developer-Kit> section. 
The Developer Kit consists of a widget template that can be easily installed inside Xcode.

If you have already installed the Developer Kit, you can jump directly into the <doc:Getting-Started-with-Pock-Widget> part.
